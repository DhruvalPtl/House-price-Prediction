## How to Run

### 1. Streamlit Web App
1. Ensure the trained model file `house_price_predic.pkl` is in the same directory as `app.py`.
2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. Open the app in your browser at the URL provided by Streamlit.

### 2. PyQt Desktop GUI
1. Ensure the trained model file `house_price_predic.pkl` is in the same directory as `ui_house_price.py`.
2. Run the PyQt app:
   ```bash
   python ui_house_price.py
   ```

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset with the following features:
- **Number of Bedrooms**
- **Number of Bathrooms**
- **Square Footage**
- **Age of the House**
- **House Price** (target)
