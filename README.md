# House Price Prediction with GUI

üè° **House Price Prediction with GUI** is a Python-based desktop application that uses machine learning to predict house prices. The application features a sleek, user-friendly interface built with PyQt6, making it easy for users to input details and receive accurate predictions.

## Features
- **Custom GUI**: Developed with PyQt6 for a modern, responsive interface.
- **Predictive Model**: Trained ML model to estimate house prices based on:
  - Number of bedrooms
  - Number of bathrooms
  - Square footage
  - House age
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Instant price calculations displayed in a clean format.
- **Dynamic Inputs**: Spinbox inputs for easy user interaction.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - PyQt6: For GUI development
  - Scikit-learn: For the ML model
  - Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation
  - Joblib: For model persistence
- **Trained Model**: Serialized and loaded using `joblib`.
